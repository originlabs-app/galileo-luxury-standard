### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8-phase structure derived from 38 requirements (governance-first approach per TradeLens research)

- 01-01: Apache 2.0 exact text used without modifications for legal clarity
- 01-01: DCO 1.1 chosen over CLA for lower contributor friction
