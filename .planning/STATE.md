## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8-phase structure derived from 38 requirements (governance-first approach per TradeLens research)
- Roadmap: Phase 4 (Identity) MUST complete before Phase 5 (Token) - critical dependency
- Roadmap: Phases 3 and 4 can run in parallel after Phase 2 (no dependency between data models and identity)
- 01-01: Apache 2.0 exact text used without modifications for legal clarity
- 01-01: DCO 1.1 chosen over CLA for lower contributor friction
- 01-04: 10-year deprecation sunset chosen for luxury industry timelines (vs. 12-24 months software norm)
- 01-04: Semiannual releases (March, September) for ERP integration predictability
- 01-04: 72-hour coordinated disclosure for critical security vulnerabilities
- 01-02: TSC composition: 11 members (6 elected + 3 appointed + 2 transitional Founding Partner)
- 01-02: Anti-dominance provision: max 2 TSC seats per organization
- 01-02: Veto on breaking changes requires technical justification + alternative proposal, 90-day resolution
- 01-02: Hybrid transparency: private deliberations, public decisions with rationale
- 01-02: 4-level graduated sanctions (correction, warning, temporary ban, permanent ban)
- 01-03: RFC review periods: 2 weeks minor, 30 days major, 60 days breaking
- 01-03: Champion assignment for each RFC to prevent abandonment
- 01-03: Lazy consensus as default decision mechanism
- 01-03: English authoritative, community translations encouraged but non-binding
- 01-06: Three revenue bands (SME <10M, Mid-Market 10M-100M, Enterprise >100M) for accessible dues
- 01-06: 50% discount for nonprofits, academics, and government agencies
- 01-06: Founding Partner window explicitly CLOSED at ratification
- 01-06: Active Contributor status is individual (meritocratic), membership is organizational
- 01-06: 60-day grace period for dues non-payment before membership lapse
- 01-05: Staggered TSC elections (~3 seats/year) for governance continuity
- 01-05: Condorcet/Schulze voting method for TSC elections
- 01-05: Time zone rotation quarterly for global participation
- 01-05: Reduced quorum (6/11) for security-only emergency sessions
- 01-05: Recordings not published to encourage candid competitor discussion
- 02-02: ML-DSA-65 (NIST Level 3) as target algorithm for standard products
- 02-02: ML-DSA-87 (NIST Level 5) for high-value items
- 02-02: 2027-2029 hybrid period requires BOTH classical AND PQC signatures valid
- 02-02: Phase 3 (2030+) accepts PQC-only, rejects classical-only
- 02-02: Key rotation NEVER invalidates historical signatures (10+ year provenance)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.

### Research Flags (from SUMMARY.md)

- **Phase 4 (Identity):** ONCHAINID integration patterns need deeper research during planning
- **Phase 5 (Token):** Requires legal review for jurisdiction-specific compliance modules
- **Phase 6 (Resolver):** GS1 Resolver CE customization requires implementation expertise
