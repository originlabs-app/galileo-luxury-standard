# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-03-09)

**Core value:** Luxury brands can prove a product's authenticity and lifecycle through a neutral, interoperable, regulation-ready Digital Product Passport that is actually verifiable end to end.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Single-Brand Workspace & Identity Baseline

## Current Position

**Current Phase:** 1 of 6 (Single-Brand Workspace & Identity Baseline)
**Current Plan:** 3
**Total Plans in Phase:** 5
**Status:** Ready to execute
**Last Activity:** 2026-03-09

**Progress:** [████░░░░░░] 40%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 5.5 min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 01 | 2 | 11 min | 5.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3 min), 01-04 (8 min)
- Trend: Stable early execution with product identity validation added after auth/session groundwork

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1]: Start with single-brand access control and product identity lock-in before any live chain integration.
- [Phase 3]: Treat Base Sepolia deployment metadata, real tx evidence, and transaction-state visibility as first-class pilot deliverables.
- [Phase 6]: Hold hosted demo readiness and security hardening as the final gate before customer-facing demonstrations.
- [Phase 01]: Dashboard auth mutations and SIWE success both rehydrate user state from /auth/me instead of trusting mutation payloads or redirect-only flow.
- [Phase 01]: Public signup may accept a brandName hint, but it must not create Brand records during the single-brand pilot.
- [Phase 01-single-brand-workspace-identity-baseline]: Centralized GTIN and serial validation in @galileo/shared so every identity-creating route rejects the same invalid inputs.
- [Phase 01-single-brand-workspace-identity-baseline]: DID and GS1 Digital Link helpers now validate identity inputs before generating persistent identifiers.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 planning must confirm the canonical Base Sepolia deployment manifest, verified contract addresses, and explorer references.
- Phase 6 planning must confirm where the public dashboard, API, and scanner will be hosted for non-engineer demos.
