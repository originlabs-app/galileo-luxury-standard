### Decisions

- 01-01: Apache 2.0 exact text used without modifications for legal clarity
- 01-01: DCO 1.1 chosen over CLA for lower contributor friction
- 01-04: 10-year deprecation sunset chosen for luxury industry timelines (vs. 12-24 months software norm)
- 01-04: Semiannual releases (March, September) for ERP integration predictability
- 01-04: 72-hour coordinated disclosure for critical security vulnerabilities
- 01-02: TSC composition: 11 members (6 elected + 3 appointed + 2 transitional Founding Partner)
- 01-02: Anti-dominance provision: max 2 TSC seats per organization
