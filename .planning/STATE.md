## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8-phase structure derived from 38 requirements (governance-first approach per TradeLens research)
- Roadmap: Phase 4 (Identity) MUST complete before Phase 5 (Token) - critical dependency
- Roadmap: Phases 3 and 4 can run in parallel after Phase 2 (no dependency between data models and identity)
- 01-01: Apache 2.0 exact text used without modifications for legal clarity
- 01-01: DCO 1.1 chosen over CLA for lower contributor friction
- 01-04: 10-year deprecation sunset chosen for luxury industry timelines (vs. 12-24 months software norm)
- 01-04: Semiannual releases (March, September) for ERP integration predictability
- 01-04: 72-hour coordinated disclosure for critical security vulnerabilities
- 01-02: TSC composition: 11 members (6 elected + 3 appointed + 2 transitional Founding Partner)
- 01-02: Anti-dominance provision: max 2 TSC seats per organization
- 01-02: Veto on breaking changes requires technical justification + alternative proposal, 90-day resolution
- 01-02: Hybrid transparency: private deliberations, public decisions with rationale
- 01-02: 4-level graduated sanctions (correction, warning, temporary ban, permanent ban)
- 01-03: RFC review periods: 2 weeks minor, 30 days major, 60 days breaking
- 01-03: Champion assignment for each RFC to prevent abandonment
- 01-03: Lazy consensus as default decision mechanism
- 01-03: English authoritative, community translations encouraged but non-binding

### Pending Todos
