### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8-phase structure derived from 38 requirements (governance-first approach per TradeLens research)
- Roadmap: Phase 4 (Identity) MUST complete before Phase 5 (Token) - critical dependency
- Roadmap: Phases 3 and 4 can run in parallel after Phase 2 (no dependency between data models and identity)
