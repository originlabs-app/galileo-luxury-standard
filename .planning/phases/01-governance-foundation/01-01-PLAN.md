<objective>
Create the intellectual property foundation for the Galileo Luxury Standard.

Purpose: Establish the specification as a non-capturable commons with clear IP rules that enable competing luxury brands to adopt without fear of lock-in or patent claims. This is GOV-03 (Documentation licence Apache 2.0 et IP).

Output: Three files establishing Apache 2.0 licensing, copyright attribution, and contribution certification.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Apache 2.0 LICENSE file</name>
  <files>governance/LICENSE</files>
  <action>
Create governance/ directory if it doesn't exist.

Create governance/LICENSE with the complete Apache License, Version 2.0 text.

Use the EXACT official text from https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt

The file should be plain text, no markdown formatting. This is the canonical Apache 2.0 license including:
- Definitions (Section 1)
- Grant of Copyright License (Section 2)
- Grant of Patent License (Section 3) - critical for adopter protection
- Redistribution requirements (Section 4)
- Submission of Contributions (Section 5)
- Trademarks (Section 6)
- Disclaimer of Warranty (Section 7)
- Limitation of Liability (Section 8)
- Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability (Section 9)

Do NOT modify the license text. Use the exact Apache Foundation wording.

  <verify>
File exists at governance/LICENSE.
File contains "Apache License" and "Version 2.0".
File contains Section 3 (Grant of Patent License).
  </verify>
  <done>
governance/LICENSE contains the complete, unmodified Apache 2.0 license text.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create NOTICE and DCO files</name>
  <files>governance/NOTICE, governance/DCO.md</files>
  <action>
Create governance/NOTICE file:
- First line: "Galileo Luxury Standard"
- Copyright line: "Copyright [year] The Galileo Luxury Standard Authors"
- Statement that this product includes software developed at the Galileo Foundation
- Note: Use [year] as placeholder - will be updated at launch

Create governance/DCO.md with:
- Title: "Developer Certificate of Origin"
- Explanation of what DCO is and why it's used (simpler than CLA, less friction per research)
- The DCO 1.1 full text (from developercertificate.org)
- Instructions for sign-off: "Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>"
- Git configuration tip: `git commit -s` to auto-sign
- Link back to LICENSE file for the Apache 2.0 terms contributors agree to

The DCO text should include all four certification points:
(a) The contribution was created by me
(b) The contribution is public domain or licensed appropriately
(c) The contribution was provided under the project license
(d) I understand this is a public record
  </action>
  <verify>
governance/NOTICE exists and contains "Galileo Luxury Standard".
governance/DCO.md exists and contains "Developer Certificate of Origin".
governance/DCO.md contains "Signed-off-by" instruction.
governance/DCO.md references Apache 2.0 license.
  </verify>
  <done>
NOTICE provides copyright attribution. DCO.md explains contribution certification with sign-off instructions.
  </done>
