<objective>
Create the versioning and release policy for the Galileo Luxury Standard.

Purpose: Ensure backward compatibility guarantees that luxury industry adopters can trust - a 10-year deprecation window aligned with luxury product lifecycles (watches passed between generations, heritage pieces). This is GOV-04 (Processus de versionnage / semver, release process).

Output: Comprehensive versioning policy document with SemVer, deprecation timeline, release schedule, and security hotfix process.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create comprehensive versioning policy</name>
  <files>governance/VERSIONING.md</files>
  <action>
Create governance/VERSIONING.md with complete versioning and release policy.

Structure:

**Versioning Policy**

1. **Version Format** (SemVer 2.0.0)
   - Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
   - MAJOR: Breaking changes (backward-incompatible)
   - MINOR: New features (backward-compatible additions)
   - PATCH: Bug fixes, clarifications (no functional change)
   - Examples:
     - 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0: Breaking change (field renamed, required field removed)
     - 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0: New optional field added
     - 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1: Typo fix, clarification
   - Pre-release: Use suffixes like -alpha, -beta, -rc.1

2. **What Constitutes a Breaking Change**
   - Removal of required field
   - Rename of existing field/property
   - Change in semantics of existing field
   - Removal of endpoint/interface
   - Change in authentication requirements
   - NOT breaking: Adding optional fields, adding new endpoints, adding new values to enums (unless closed enum)

3. **Release Schedule** (from CONTEXT.md)
   - Minor releases: Semiannual (March, September)
   - Patch releases: As needed, typically monthly
   - Major releases: Only when necessary, minimum 60-day RFC review
   - Rationale: Semiannual cadence provides predictability for ERP integrations

4. **Release Process**
   - Feature freeze: 4 weeks before release
   - Release candidate: 2 weeks before release
   - Release notes: Published with every release
   - Changelog: Maintained in CHANGELOG.md

5. **Deprecation Policy** (from CONTEXT.md - 10 years)
   - Sunset period: 10 years from deprecation announcement
   - Rationale: Luxury goods have multi-generational lifecycles; watches, jewelry, and heritage pieces may be held for decades
   - Contrast: Standard software deprecation (12-24 months) is inappropriate for this domain

6. **Deprecation Process**
   - Announcement: Deprecated features marked in next minor release
   - Notification schedule:
     - At deprecation announcement
     - 5 years before sunset
     - 2 years before sunset
     - 1 year before sunset
     - 6 months before sunset
     - 3 months before sunset (final warning)
   - Documentation: Deprecated feature docs maintained until sunset
   - Migration guide: Required for all deprecations

7. **HTTP Headers for API Deprecation** (per RFC 8594, RFC 9745)
   - Sunset header: `Sunset: Sat, 31 Dec 2035 23:59:59 GMT`
   - Deprecation header: `Deprecation: @1577836800`
   - Link header: Points to migration documentation

8. **Security Hotfixes** (from CONTEXT.md - 72 hours)
   - Critical vulnerabilities: 72-hour coordinated disclosure
   - Process:
     1. Private notification to known adopters (72 hours before public)
     2. Patch release prepared and tested
     3. Public release and security advisory
     4. CVE assigned if applicable
   - Communication: security@galileo.luxury (placeholder)
   - Severity: CVSS scoring for vulnerability assessment

9. **Version Support Matrix**
   - Latest MAJOR: Full support
   - Previous MAJOR: Security fixes only (during 10-year sunset)
   - Older MAJOR: Community support only (post-sunset)

10. **Specification Version in Documents**
    - All specification documents include version in header
    - JSON-LD @context includes version in URL
    - Example: `https://spec.galileo.luxury/v1/context.jsonld`

11. **Backward Compatibility Commitment**
    - Forward compatible: New versions can read old data
    - Not backward compatible: Old versions may not read new data (by design)
    - Conformant implementations: Must support current MAJOR version

Include a version history table template at the end.

<success_criteria>
- GOV-04 requirement satisfied: Versioning policy complete
- Adopters have 10-year guarantee against forced obsolescence
- Release schedule is predictable for enterprise planning
- Security process is fast (72h) but coordinated
- Policy reflects luxury industry timelines, not software industry norms
</success_criteria>
