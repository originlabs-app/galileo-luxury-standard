<objective>
Create the membership system documentation for the Galileo Luxury Standard.

Purpose: Define clear membership tiers that enable both large luxury houses and small artisans to participate appropriately - with revenue-scaled dues for accessibility and explicit rights at each level. This supports GOV-01 (règles de participation).

Output: Two files - membership tier definitions and legal membership agreement template.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create membership levels documentation</name>
  <files>governance/membership/MEMBERSHIP_LEVELS.md</files>
  <action>
Create governance/membership/ directory if it doesn't exist.

Create governance/membership/MEMBERSHIP_LEVELS.md defining the three-tier membership structure.

Structure:

**Membership Levels**

1. **Overview**
   - Three tiers: Observer, Member, Founding Partner
   - All commercial use of specification free under Apache 2.0
   - Paid membership supports governance operations, not spec access

2. **Observer** (Free tier - per CONTEXT.md)
   - Cost: Free
   - Rights:
     - Full access to all specifications
     - Participate in RFC process (submit, comment)
     - Attend public TSC meetings as observer (no voting)
     - Commercial use of specification under Apache 2.0
     - Use conformance testing tools
     - List as "Galileo Standard Conformant" (if passing tests)
   - Obligations:
     - Comply with Code of Conduct
     - No voting rights on governance matters
   - Registration: Self-registration via website (placeholder)

3. **Member** (Paid tier)
   - Cost: Annual dues scaled by revenue (see Dues Schedule below)
   - Rights (in addition to Observer rights):
     - Vote on Governing Board matters
     - Nominate candidates for elected TSC seats
     - Vote in TSC elections (if Active Contributor)
     - Access detailed meeting minutes
     - Early access to release candidates (2 weeks before public)
     - Logo on "Members" page of website
     - Participate in working groups
   - Obligations:
     - Annual dues payment
     - Designate organizational contact
     - Comply with Code of Conduct
   - Process: Application reviewed by Governing Board (membership committee)

4. **Founding Partner** (Closed tier - per CONTEXT.md)
   - Status: CLOSED - Enrollment window ended at charter ratification
   - Original rights (grandfathered for existing Founding Partners):
     - All Member rights
     - Guaranteed Governing Board seat (for first 5 years)
     - 2 reserved TSC seats (transitional, sunset after 3 years)
     - Recognition as founding organization
     - Input on initial governance decisions
   - Original obligations:
     - Significant founding contribution (financial and/or FTE)
     - Multi-year commitment
     - Active participation in governance formation
   - Note: No new Founding Partners can join. This tier exists only for historical documentation of founding organizations.

5. **Dues Schedule** (per CONTEXT.md - revenue-scaled)
   - Purpose: Ensure accessibility for SMEs and artisans while supporting operations
   - Bands based on annual revenue (CA):
     - SME (<€10M revenue): €[X]/year
     - Mid-size (€10M-€100M revenue): €[Y]/year
     - Enterprise (>€100M revenue): €[Z]/year
   - Note: Exact amounts TBD by Governing Board before launch
   - Self-reporting: Organizations self-report revenue band
   - Verification: May be requested for Enterprise tier
   - Nonprofit/Academic: 50% discount on applicable tier

6. **Changing Membership Level**
   - Upgrade: Apply and pay prorated dues
   - Downgrade: Effective at next renewal
   - Lapse: 60-day grace period, then automatic downgrade to Observer

7. **Organizational vs. Individual**
   - Membership is organizational, not individual
   - Organization designates representatives for voting/participation
   - Active Contributor status is individual (tied to person's contributions)

8. **Comparison Table**

| Right | Observer | Member | Founding Partner |
|-------|----------|--------|------------------|
| Spec access | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Commercial use | Yes (Apache 2.0) | Yes | Yes |
| Submit RFCs | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Comment on RFCs | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Attend public meetings | Yes (observe) | Yes | Yes |
| Vote on governance | No | Yes | Yes |
| TSC election voting* | No | Yes* | Yes* |
| Detailed minutes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Board seat | No | No | Yes (5yr) |
| Reserved TSC seats | No | No | Yes (3yr, transitional) |

*If Active Contributor
