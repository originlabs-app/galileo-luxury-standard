<objective>
Create the constitutional governance framework for the Galileo Luxury Standard.

Purpose: Establish neutral, independent governance that prevents single-organization control and enables competing luxury brands to participate - directly addressing the TradeLens failure lesson. This is GOV-01 core (Charte de gouvernance).

Output: Two files - the governance charter (constitutional document) and code of conduct (behavioral standards).

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Governance Charter</name>
  <files>governance/CHARTER.md</files>
  <action>
Create governance/CHARTER.md following the Hyperledger Foundation Charter structure from research.

Structure the charter with these sections:

1. **Mission and Scope**
   - Mission: Establish interoperable digital product identity standard for luxury goods
   - Core value: "Protéger le patrimoine des marques et le savoir-faire humain"
   - Scope: Specification development, reference implementations, certification program

2. **Membership Categories** (from CONTEXT.md decisions)
   - Founding Partners: Time-limited enrollment window (closes at charter ratification), FTE commitment for TSC
   - Members: Paid tier, voting rights, revenue-scaled dues (SME/Mid/Enterprise bands)
   - Observers: Free access, RFC participation, no voting rights, commercial use under Apache 2.0
   - Reference: Full details in membership/MEMBERSHIP_LEVELS.md

3. **Governing Board** (strategic decisions)
   - Composition: Representatives from Member and Founding Partner organizations
   - Responsibilities: Budget, strategy, membership policies, trademark
   - Voting: Majority for standard decisions, 2/3 for charter amendments

4. **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)** (technical decisions - from CONTEXT.md)
   - Composition: 11 members (hybrid Hyperledger model)
     - 6 elected by Active Contributors (meritocratic)
     - 3 appointed by Governing Board (expertise/diversity)
     - 2 from Founding Partners (transitional, expires after 3 years)
   - Active Contributor definition: Accepted contribution in prior 12 months
   - Term limits: 2-year terms, renewable once, 1-year gap before re-election
   - Responsibilities: Specification approval, RFC decisions, technical roadmap
   - Reference: Detailed procedures in tsc/ directory

5. **Voting Procedures**
   - Quorum: 2/3 of voting members
   - Standard decisions: Majority of members present
   - Breaking changes: Unanimous consent with veto rights (per CONTEXT.md)
   - Electronic voting: Majority of all members (not just those voting)

6. **Veto Mechanism for Breaking Changes** (critical - from CONTEXT.md)
   - Definition: Changes that make conformant implementations non-conformant
   - Veto rights: Any TSC member can veto breaking changes
   - Requirements: Written declaration, technical justification, alternative proposal
   - Override: Unanimous TSC consent OR 2/3 Governing Board vote
   - Resolution period: 90 days for negotiation

7. **Intellectual Property Policy**
   - License: Apache License 2.0 (reference governance/LICENSE)
   - Contributions: DCO sign-off required (reference governance/DCO.md)
   - Patent grant: Per Apache 2.0 Section 3
   - Trademarks: Held by Foundation, usage policy TBD

8. **Transparency Policy** (from CONTEXT.md - hybrid model)
   - Deliberations: Private (protects competitive concerns between brands)
   - Decisions: Published with full rationale
   - Meeting minutes: Summary published, detailed minutes for members
   - Decision log: Public, immutable

9. **Antitrust Compliance**
   - Safe harbor language for competitor collaboration
   - Prohibited topics: Pricing, market allocation, customer restrictions
   - Legal counsel availability for sensitive discussions

10. **Code of Conduct**
    - Reference to governance/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
    - Applies to all participants in all venues

11. **Amendments**
    - Process: RFC submitted, 60-day review, 2/3 Board vote
    - Effective date: 30 days after approval

Include a "Version History" section at the end (initially: v1.0.0-draft).

Use formal but accessible language. Reference Ostrom's commons principles implicitly through the structure (clear boundaries, participatory decision-making, graduated sanctions, conflict resolution).

  <name>Task 2: Create Code of Conduct</name>
  <files>governance/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</files>
  <action>
Create governance/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md based on the Contributor Covenant 2.1 (as recommended in research).

Structure:

1. **Our Pledge**
   - Inclusive, harassment-free environment
   - Commitment to diversity (age, body size, disability, ethnicity, etc.)

2. **Our Standards**
   - Examples of positive behavior (empathy, constructive feedback, accepting responsibility)
   - Examples of unacceptable behavior (harassment, trolling, personal attacks)

3. **Enforcement Responsibilities**
   - TSC responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards
   - Right to remove/edit/reject contributions that violate standards

4. **Scope**
   - Applies to all project spaces (repos, mailing lists, meetings)
   - Applies when representing the project in public spaces
   - Applies at events and conferences

5. **Enforcement**
   - Report violations to: [conduct@galileo.luxury] (placeholder email)
   - All complaints reviewed promptly and fairly
   - Privacy and security of reporters respected

6. **Enforcement Guidelines** (graduated sanctions per Ostrom)
   - Level 1 - Correction: Private warning, explanation of violation
   - Level 2 - Warning: Formal warning, no interaction with involved parties
   - Level 3 - Temporary Ban: Temporary suspension from participation
   - Level 4 - Permanent Ban: Permanent removal from project

7. **Attribution**
   - Credit Contributor Covenant version 2.1
   - Link to https://www.contributor-covenant.org

Make it professional and suitable for luxury industry participants (brands, artisans, technology partners) while maintaining the community standards that make open source collaboration work.
