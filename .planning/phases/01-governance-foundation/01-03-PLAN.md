<objective>
Create the RFC contribution process for the Galileo Luxury Standard.

Purpose: Enable any organization to propose specification changes through a structured, transparent process - ensuring the standard evolves based on industry needs rather than single-vendor interests. This is GOV-02 (Processus de contribution / RFC process).

Output: Three files - RFC process description, RFC template (Rust-style), and overall contributing guide.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create RFC process documentation</name>
  <files>governance/rfcs/README.md</files>
  <action>
Create governance/rfcs/ directory if it doesn't exist.

Create governance/rfcs/README.md describing the RFC process:

**RFC Process**

1. **What is an RFC?**
   - Request for Comments - formal proposal for specification changes
   - Required for: New features, breaking changes, significant modifications
   - Not required for: Typos, clarifications, editorial fixes

2. **Who can submit?**
   - Anyone (Open Contribution per CONTEXT.md)
   - No membership required to submit
   - TSC reviews based on merit, not submitter status

3. **RFC Lifecycle**
   - Draft: Author prepares RFC using template
   - Submitted: PR opened against rfcs/ directory
   - Champion assigned: TSC member shepherds the RFC (prevents RFC abandonment per research pitfall)
   - Review period: Public comment period based on change type
   - Decision: TSC votes (Accept/Reject/Defer)
   - Implementation: If accepted, merged and implemented in target version

4. **Review Periods** (from CONTEXT.md decisions)
   - Minor changes (non-breaking): 2 weeks
   - Major changes (new features): 30 days
   - Breaking changes: 60 days (plus veto period)

5. **Decision Process**
   - Lazy consensus: If no objections by deadline, RFC proceeds
   - Explicit vote: For contested RFCs, TSC votes
   - Breaking changes: Require veto-free TSC approval (see CHARTER.md)

6. **RFC Numbering**
   - Sequential integers: 0001, 0002, 0003...
   - Assigned when RFC is accepted (not at submission)
   - Draft RFCs use placeholder: XXXX

7. **Language**
   - Official language: English (per CONTEXT.md)
   - Community translations encouraged but not authoritative

8. **RFC Statuses**
   - Draft: Work in progress
   - Submitted: Under review
   - Accepted: Approved for implementation
   - Implemented: Released in specification version
   - Rejected: Not accepted (with rationale documented)
   - Withdrawn: Author withdrew
   - Deferred: Postponed for future consideration

Include a table of active RFCs (initially empty) and link to 0000-template.md.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create RFC template</name>
  <files>governance/rfcs/0000-template.md</files>
  <action>
Create governance/rfcs/0000-template.md following the Rust RFC template format (per research recommendation).

Structure with 9 sections:

```markdown
# RFC-XXXX: [Title]

- **RFC Number:** XXXX (assigned on acceptance)
- **Title:** [Descriptive title]
- **Author:** [Name (organization)]
- **Champion:** [TSC member - assigned after submission]
- **Status:** Draft | Submitted | Accepted | Implemented | Rejected | Withdrawn | Deferred
- **Created:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Review Deadline:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (calculated from submission based on change type)
- **Spec Version Target:** [e.g., 1.3.0]

## Summary

One paragraph explanation of the proposal.

## Motivation

Why is this change needed? What problem does it solve?
- What use cases does this enable?
- What pain points does this address?
- Who benefits from this change?

## Guide-level explanation

Explain the proposal as if teaching it to an adopter who will implement it.
- Use examples and scenarios
- Explain concepts in plain language
- Focus on the "what" and "how to use"

## Reference-level explanation

Technical specification of the proposal.
- Precise definitions and semantics
- Edge cases and corner cases
- Interaction with existing features
- Schema changes, if applicable (JSON-LD, etc.)

## Drawbacks

Why should we NOT do this?
- What are the costs?
- What complexity does this add?
- Who is negatively impacted?

## Rationale and alternatives

Why is this the best design among alternatives?
- What alternatives were considered?
- Why were they rejected?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior art

How do other standards/systems handle this?
- Existing approaches in luxury industry
- Approaches in adjacent domains (supply chain, identity, etc.)
- Lessons learned from prior art

## Unresolved questions

What questions need resolution during the RFC process?
- Implementation details to be determined
- Open design questions
- Dependencies on other work

## Future possibilities

What extensions or follow-on work might this enable?
- Not a commitment, but potential directions
- How might this evolve?

[This section is populated during the review process]

## Decision

[Populated by TSC after decision]
- **Decision:** Accepted | Rejected | Deferred
- **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Rationale:** [Explanation]

  <name>Task 3: Create CONTRIBUTING guide</name>
  <files>governance/CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>
Create governance/CONTRIBUTING.md as the entry point for all contributors.

Structure:

**Contributing to the Galileo Luxury Standard**

1. **Welcome**
   - Brief intro to the standard and its mission
   - All contributions welcome regardless of membership status

2. **Ways to Contribute**
   - Report issues: Bug reports, spec ambiguities
   - Propose changes: RFC process for significant changes
   - Review RFCs: Comment during review periods
   - Documentation: Improve clarity, add examples
   - Reference implementations: Build conformant implementations
   - Translations: Community translations (non-authoritative)

3. **Getting Started**
   - Read the specification (link TBD)
   - Join the mailing list / discussion forum (placeholder)
   - Review open RFCs
   - Attend public TSC meetings (observer status)

4. **Contribution Process**
   - For small changes (typos, clarifications): Direct PR
   - For significant changes: RFC process (link to rfcs/README.md)
   - All contributions require DCO sign-off (link to DCO.md)

5. **DCO Sign-off** (from GOV-03)
   - What: Developer Certificate of Origin certification
   - How: Add "Signed-off-by: Name <email>" to commits
   - Git shortcut: `git commit -s`
   - Why: Certifies you have the right to submit under Apache 2.0

6. **Code of Conduct**
   - Reference CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
   - Expected behavior in all interactions

7. **Questions?**
   - Contact: [email placeholder]
   - Public discussion: [forum placeholder]

Keep the document welcoming and accessible - many contributors will be from luxury brands, not open source veterans.
