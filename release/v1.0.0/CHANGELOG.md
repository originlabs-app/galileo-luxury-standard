## [1.2.0] — 2026-02-22

### Added

#### Smart Contract Implementations (Solidity / Foundry)

Complete Solidity implementation of all Galileo Protocol interfaces defined in v1.0.0, built on ERC-3643 (T-REX v4.1.3) with OpenZeppelin v4.9.6.

**Infrastructure**
- `GalileoAccessControl.sol` — RBAC with ONCHAINID integration, 5 roles (Brand Admin, Operator, Auditor, Regulator, Service Center Admin), two-phase grants, suspension, emergency access (60 tests)

**Identity Layer**
- `GalileoClaimTopicsRegistry.sol` — Claim topic management with group organization, batch operations, and topic metadata (47 tests)
- `GalileoTrustedIssuersRegistry.sol` — Trusted issuer registry with suspension/revocation, expiry tracking, and delegation (65 tests)
- `GalileoIdentityRegistryStorage.sol` — Identity data storage with brand DID binding and federated lookup (68 tests)
- `GalileoIdentityRegistry.sol` — Identity verification engine with consortium features, batch verification, and GDPR consent checking (61 tests)

**Token**
- `GalileoToken.sol` — Single-supply ERC-20 product token (1 token = 1 physical product) with ERC-3643 compliance pipeline, CPO certification lifecycle, `transferWithReason`, decommission, and freeze/unfreeze (141 tests)

**Compliance Engine**
- `GalileoCompliance.sol` — Modular compliance engine with ordered module execution, batch checks, detailed failure reasons, emergency pause, and module introspection (53 tests)
- `BaseComplianceModule.sol` — Abstract base for all compliance modules with bind/unbind lifecycle
- `BrandAuthorizationModule.sol` — Verifies authorized retailers via identity claims (35 tests)
- `CPOCertificationModule.sol` — Enforces CPO requirements for secondary market sales (35 tests)
- `JurisdictionModule.sol` — Country-based transfer restrictions and export controls (36 tests)
- `SanctionsModule.sol` — OFAC/EU sanctions screening via Chainalysis oracle (40 tests)
- `ServiceCenterModule.sol` — MRO authorization for service transfers (39 tests)

**Integration & Deployment**
- `FullLifecycle.t.sol` — End-to-end integration test covering the complete luxury product lifecycle: creation, compliance setup, identity verification, transfers, CPO certification, service center MRO, and decommission (40 tests)
- `Deploy.s.sol` — Full-stack deployment script for all contracts

**Test Coverage: 722 tests (0 failures, 0 skipped)**

| Test Suite | Tests |
|------------|-------|
| GalileoToken | 141 |
| IdentityRegistryStorage | 68 |
| TrustedIssuersRegistry | 65 |
| IdentityRegistry | 61 |
| AccessControl | 60 |
| GalileoCompliance | 53 |

| ServiceCenterModule | 39 |
| JurisdictionModule | 36 |
| BrandAuthorizationModule | 35 |
| CPOCertificationModule | 35 |
| **Total** | **722** |

### Fixed

- `vm.prank` consumption by staticcalls in Foundry test arguments — cached role constants in `setUp()` to prevent external view calls from consuming prank context
- Stale suspension flag deadlock in `TrustedIssuersRegistry.suspendIssuer` — uses live state check instead of cached flag
- Decommissioned token allowing mint/forcedTransfer — added decommission guard to both operations
- Identity registry claim verification robustness — added try/catch safety to `getClaim` and `getClaimIdsByTopic` external calls
