## 1. Current Composition

The TSC consists of eleven (11) voting members as defined in [CHARTER.md](../CHARTER.md) Section 4.1.

| Seats | Type | Selection Method | Term Length |
|-------|------|------------------|-------------|
| 6 | Elected | Elected by Active Contributors | 2 years |
| 3 | Appointed | Appointed by Governing Board (expertise/diversity) | 2 years |
| 2 | Founding Partner (Transitional) | Designated by Founding Partners | Until 3 years post-ratification |

**Anti-Dominance Provision:** No single organization may hold more than two (2) TSC seats simultaneously. If elections or appointments would result in exceeding this limit, the excess seat(s) pass to the next eligible candidate(s).

---

## 2. Seat Types Explained

### 2.1 Elected Seats (6)

Elected seats represent the Active Contributor community. These members are chosen through annual elections held each September.

**Selection Process:**
- Nominations open to all Active Contributors
- Voting by Active Contributors using ranked-choice voting
- Staggered terms: approximately 3 seats elected each year
- Results published within 7 days of voting close

**Purpose:** Ensures technical governance reflects the views of those actively building and maintaining the Standard.

### 2.2 Appointed Seats (3)

Appointed seats are selected by the Governing Board to fill expertise and diversity gaps in the TSC composition.

**Selection Criteria:**
- Fill gaps in technical expertise not represented by elected members
- Ensure geographic diversity across luxury market regions
- Balance industry segment representation (haute couture, horlogerie, joaillerie, maroquinerie, etc.)
- Bring external perspective from adjacent standards bodies or academia

**Purpose:** Ensures the TSC has comprehensive expertise and represents the full breadth of the luxury goods industry.

### 2.3 Founding Partner Seats (2) - Transitional

Reserved for Founding Partner organizations during the Standard's launch phase.

**Selection:** Founding Partners jointly nominate representatives from among their organizations.

**Transitional Nature:**
- These seats expire three (3) years after Charter ratification
- Upon expiration, these seats convert to elected seats
- Founding Partner representatives may run for elected seats after transition
- Current representatives may complete their term if expiration falls mid-term

**Purpose:** Ensures founding organizations have representation during critical early development while maintaining meritocratic governance long-term.
