# Galileo Luxury Standard - Governance Charter

**Version:** 1.0.0-draft
**Effective Date:** Upon Ratification
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-30

---

## Preamble

This Charter establishes the governance framework for the Galileo Luxury Standard, an open industrial specification for digital product identity and traceability in the luxury goods sector. The governance structure is designed to ensure neutrality, prevent single-organization control, and enable competing luxury brands to collaborate on a shared standard that protects their heritage and craftsmanship.

The principles guiding this governance are inspired by successful open source foundations (Linux Foundation, Hyperledger, CNCF) and Elinor Ostrom's research on governing commons: clear boundaries, participatory decision-making, graduated sanctions, and effective conflict resolution.

## 1. Mission and Scope

### 1.1 Mission

The mission of the Galileo Luxury Standard is to establish an interoperable digital product identity standard for luxury goods that:

- Creates an immutable digital memory for objects spanning multiple decades
- Enables provenance verification independent of proprietary platforms
- Allows competing brands to collaborate without competitive sacrifice
- Prepares the industry for ESPR Digital Product Passport requirements (2027)

### 1.2 Core Value

> **"Proteger le patrimoine des marques et le savoir-faire humain"**
>
> Protect brand heritage and human craftsmanship through a common language enabling interoperability between competing brands without competitive sacrifice or platform dependency.

### 1.3 Scope

The Standard encompasses:

- **Specification Development:** Technical specifications for digital product identity, lifecycle events, and compliance interfaces
- **Reference Implementations:** Non-production reference code demonstrating specification compliance
- **Certification Program:** Conformance testing and certification for implementations
- **Educational Materials:** Documentation enabling adopter implementation

The Standard explicitly excludes:

- Production-ready smart contract implementations
- User interface or frontend applications

---

## 6. Veto Mechanism for Breaking Changes

This section establishes protections for Standard adopters against disruptive specification changes.

### 6.1 Definition of Breaking Change

A **breaking change** is any modification to the specification that would:
- Cause a previously-conformant implementation to become non-conformant
- Remove or fundamentally alter the semantics of existing features
- Change mandatory requirements in a non-backward-compatible manner
- Modify identifier formats, data structures, or interfaces in incompatible ways

Clarifications, bug fixes, and additive changes are NOT breaking changes.

### 6.2 Veto Rights

Any TSC member may exercise a veto on proposed breaking changes. A veto must:

1. **Be Timely:** Declared in writing during the RFC review period
2. **Be Justified:** Include specific technical justification referencing adopter impact
3. **Be Constructive:** Propose an alternative approach or conditions for lifting the veto

A veto without these elements is procedurally invalid.

### 6.3 Veto Effect

A valid veto:
- Immediately suspends the RFC approval process
- Triggers a ninety (90) day resolution period
- Requires public documentation of the veto rationale

### 6.4 Resolution Process

During the resolution period:
1. The TSC Chair facilitates negotiation between veto holder and RFC authors
2. Working sessions are convened as needed
3. Alternative proposals are explored
4. Affected adopters may provide input

### 6.5 Veto Override

A veto may be overridden only by:
- **Unanimous TSC Consent:** All other TSC members (excluding veto holder) agree to override, OR
- **Governing Board Override:** Two-thirds (2/3) vote of the full Governing Board

Override requires documented finding that the veto is:
- Not technically justified, OR
- Contrary to the Standard's mission and adopter interests

### 6.6 Unresolved Vetoes

If a veto remains unresolved after the 90-day period:
- The RFC is tabled
- May be reintroduced after twelve (12) months with substantial modifications
- Original veto holder must be notified of reintroduction
