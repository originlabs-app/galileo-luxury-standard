# Contributing to the Galileo Luxury Standard

## Welcome

The Galileo Luxury Standard is an open, neutral standard for product traceability and provenance in the luxury goods industry. We believe that protecting brand heritage and human craftsmanship requires a common language that enables interoperability between competing brands without sacrificing competitive advantage or creating platform dependencies.

**All contributions are welcome**, regardless of your membership status. Whether you represent a major maison, an independent artisan, a technology provider, or are simply passionate about luxury goods authenticity, your input is valued.

## Ways to Contribute

### Report Issues

Found an ambiguity in the specification? Encountered a problem implementing it? We want to know.

- **Bug reports**: Errors or inconsistencies in the specification
- **Clarification requests**: Sections that are unclear or confusing
- **Implementation feedback**: Real-world issues discovered during adoption

Open an issue describing the problem and, if possible, suggest a solution.

### Propose Changes

Significant changes to the specification go through our RFC (Request for Comments) process:

- **New features or capabilities**
- **Modifications to existing features**
- **Breaking changes** (require extended review)

See [rfcs/README.md](rfcs/README.md) for the complete RFC process.

### Review RFCs

Active RFCs need community input during their review periods:

- Read open RFC pull requests
- Comment with technical feedback
- Share implementation perspectives
- Raise concerns or suggest improvements

Your review helps ensure the standard evolves to meet real industry needs.

### Improve Documentation

Clear documentation lowers the barrier to adoption:

- Fix typos, grammar, and formatting
- Add examples and clarifications
- Improve diagrams and illustrations
- Translate documentation (see Language section below)

Minor documentation fixes can be submitted as direct pull requests without an RFC.

### Build Reference Implementations

Demonstrate that the specification works in practice:

- Create conformant implementations
- Share implementation guides
- Contribute test suites
- Report implementation experiences

### Translate

Make the standard accessible to non-English speakers:

- Translate specification documents
- Translate documentation and guides

**Note**: The English version is authoritative. Translations are community-maintained and non-binding.

## Getting Started

1. **Read the specification** to understand what you're contributing to
2. **Review open RFCs** to see current discussions
3. **Join public TSC meetings** as an observer to understand governance
4. **Start small** - a documentation fix or RFC comment is a great first contribution

## Contribution Process

### For Small Changes

Typos, grammar fixes, formatting improvements, and minor clarifications:

1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a Pull Request with a clear description
4. A maintainer will review and merge

No RFC required for editorial changes that don't affect specification semantics.

### For Significant Changes

New features, behavioral changes, or modifications to existing functionality:

1. **Draft an RFC** using the [RFC template](rfcs/0000-template.md)
2. **Open a Pull Request** with title `RFC: [Your Title]`
3. **Engage with feedback** during the review period
4. **Revise as needed** based on community input
5. **Await TSC decision** after the review period ends

Review periods vary by change type:
- Minor changes: 2 weeks
- Major changes: 30 days
- Breaking changes: 60 days

See [rfcs/README.md](rfcs/README.md) for complete details.

## DCO Sign-off

All contributions require a [Developer Certificate of Origin](DCO.md) sign-off.

### What is the DCO?

The DCO certifies that you have the right to submit your contribution and agree to license it under Apache 2.0. It's a lightweight alternative to Contributor License Agreements (CLAs).

### How to Sign Off

Add the following line to your commit messages:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

**Git shortcut**: Use the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

### Why We Require This

- Ensures all contributions can be legally included in the standard
- Protects both contributors and the project
- Certifies you have the right to submit under Apache 2.0
- Industry standard practice (Linux Foundation, Apache projects)

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment. All contributors are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

**Expected behavior:**

- Be respectful and professional
- Welcome diverse perspectives
- Focus on what's best for the industry
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully

**Unacceptable behavior:**

- Harassment or discrimination
- Personal attacks
- Publishing others' private information
- Other conduct inappropriate for a professional setting

Report violations to [conduct@galileoprotocol.io](mailto:conduct@galileoprotocol.io).

## Language

The official language of the Galileo Luxury Standard is **English**.

- All specification text is in English
- All RFC discussions are conducted in English
- All TSC meetings are held in English
- The English version is authoritative for interpretation

**Community translations** are encouraged to improve accessibility, but they are non-binding. In case of discrepancy, the English version prevails.

## Recognition

Contributors are recognized in several ways:

- **Git history** preserves authorship
- **RFC authorship** is recorded in accepted RFCs
- **Contributor lists** acknowledge significant contributions
- **Active Contributors** may become eligible for TSC election

## Questions?

- **Technical questions**: Open an issue
- **Process questions**: Review this document and [rfcs/README.md](rfcs/README.md)
- **Governance questions**: See [CHARTER.md](CHARTER.md)
