## Special Provisions

### Interactions Between Competitors

The luxury goods industry includes competing brands. All participants must:
- Maintain professional conduct regardless of competitive relationships
- Not use Code of Conduct processes for competitive advantage
- Report actual violations, not strategic complaints
- Accept that competitors participating in good faith are welcome

False or malicious reports are themselves Code of Conduct violations.

### TSC and Board Member Conduct

TSC and Board members are held to higher standards:
- Violations by leaders are treated as more serious due to their position
- Leaders must model expected behavior
- Leaders must recuse themselves from enforcement decisions involving their organizations

### Confidential Information

Participants with access to confidential information (private deliberations, unreleased specifications) must:
- Maintain confidentiality as specified in governance documents
- Not use confidential information for competitive advantage
- Report suspected confidentiality breaches
