# Galileo Luxury Standard - Membership Levels

**Version:** 1.0.0-draft
**Effective Date:** Upon Charter Ratification
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-30

---

## 1. Overview

The Galileo Luxury Standard operates a three-tier membership structure designed to enable participation from organizations of all sizes, from global luxury conglomerates to independent artisan ateliers.

### Core Principles

- **Specification Access is Free:** All specifications are available under Apache License 2.0, enabling unrestricted commercial use without membership
- **Membership Supports Governance:** Paid membership funds governance operations, not specification access
- **Revenue-Scaled Accessibility:** Dues are scaled by organization revenue to ensure SMEs and artisans can participate meaningfully
- **Meritocratic Influence:** Technical influence is earned through contribution, not payment

### Membership Tiers

| Tier | Cost | Governance Rights | Target Audience |
|------|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Observer | Free | Participate, no vote | Startups, researchers, evaluators |
| Member | Scaled dues | Full voting rights | Committed adopters |
| Founding Partner | Closed | Enhanced (transitional) | Launch participants only |

---

## 4. Founding Partner Tier

**Status: CLOSED**

> **Important:** The Founding Partner enrollment window closed at Charter ratification. No new Founding Partners may be admitted. This section documents historical privileges for existing Founding Partners only.

### 4.1 Purpose

Founding Partners are organizations that made significant commitments during the Standard's formation, providing the foundation for neutral governance and initial specification development.

### 4.2 Original Enrollment Requirements

(For historical reference only)

- **Personnel Commitment:** Minimum 0.5 FTE dedicated to TSC participation
- **Financial Contribution:** Founding contribution per Membership Agreement
- **Multi-Year Commitment:** Minimum 3-year participation commitment
- **Mission Alignment:** Demonstrated commitment to neutral, open standard
- **Active Participation:** Engagement in governance formation decisions

### 4.3 Founding Partner Rights

Existing Founding Partners retain all Member rights plus:

| Right | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Governing Board Seat** | 5 years from ratification | One guaranteed Board seat per Founding Partner |
| **TSC Reserved Seats** | 3 years from ratification | Two collective seats reserved for Founding Partner designees |
| **Recognition** | Permanent | Listed as Founding Partner in official materials |
| **Historical Input** | Transitional | Input on initial governance decisions |

### 4.4 Transitional Provisions

Founding Partner privileges are time-limited to prevent permanent two-class hierarchy:

| Privilege | Sunset Date | Post-Sunset Status |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Guaranteed Board seat | Ratification + 5 years | Must seek election like other Members |
| Reserved TSC seats | Ratification + 3 years | Individuals must seek election as Active Contributors |
| "Founding Partner" recognition | Never expires | Permanent historical acknowledgment |

After privilege sunset, Founding Partners retain full Member status and rights.

### 4.5 Why the Window is Closed

The closed enrollment window:
- Prevents late-entry privilege seeking
- Ensures governance legitimacy (founders took genuine risk)
- Avoids permanent elite class
- Maintains meritocratic principles

Organizations seeking participation should apply as Members. The Member tier provides full governance participation rights.
