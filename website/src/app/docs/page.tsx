      <h1>Introduction to Galileo</h1>

      <p className="text-xl text-[var(--platinum)] leading-relaxed">
        Galileo is an open standard that enables luxury brands to protect heritage
        and craftsmanship through interoperable, blockchain-based product authentication.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Galileo?</h2>
      <p>
        The luxury industry faces unprecedented challenges: counterfeiting costs brands
        billions annually, new regulations like ESPR mandate Digital Product Passports,
        and consumers demand transparency. Existing solutions are proprietary silos that
        don&apos;t interoperate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Galileo solves this by providing a neutral, open standard that any brand can adopt.
        Like HTTP for the web, Galileo creates a common language for luxury product data.
      </p>

      <h2>Core Principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Open & Neutral</strong> — Apache 2.0 licensed, governed by a Technical Steering
          Committee with anti-dominance rules preventing any single organization from control.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Privacy-First</strong> — GDPR-compliant hybrid architecture keeps personal data
          off-chain while anchoring ownership proofs on-chain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regulation-Ready</strong> — Designed from the ground up for ESPR (Digital Product
          Passports), MiCA (crypto asset regulation), and GDPR compliance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Interoperable</strong> — Built on W3C standards (DIDs, Verifiable Credentials),
          GS1 Digital Link, and ERC-3643 for maximum compatibility.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What&apos;s in the Standard?</h2>
      <p>
        Galileo v1.0.0 includes 38 specifications covering:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Identity</strong> — DID method, ONCHAINID integration, Verifiable Credentials</li>
        <li><strong>Token</strong> — ERC-3643 extension for luxury products, compliance modules</li>
        <li><strong>Data</strong> — ESPR-ready DPP schema, EPCIS 2.0 lifecycle events</li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure</strong> — GS1 resolver, access control, audit trails</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance</strong> — GDPR, MiCA, and ESPR implementation guides</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who is Galileo For?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Luxury Brands</strong> — Implement authentic product certificates</li>
        <li><strong>Technology Providers</strong> — Build compliant solutions on open standards</li>
        <li><strong>Regulators</strong> — Understand how the standard meets requirements</li>
        <li><strong>Researchers</strong> — Study blockchain applications in luxury</li>
      </ul>
