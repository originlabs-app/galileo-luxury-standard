## A New Era for Luxury Authenticity

Today marks a significant milestone for the luxury industry. After months of rigorous specification, security audits, and community collaboration, we are proud to announce **Galileo Protocol v1.0.0** - the first production-ready, open-source standard for luxury goods authentication and provenance tracking.

Galileo Protocol establishes a common, interoperable language for protecting brand heritage and human craftsmanship in an increasingly digital world.

---

## The Problem We Solve

### The Counterfeiting Crisis

The global counterfeiting market exceeds **$500 billion annually**, with luxury goods among the most targeted sectors. Traditional authentication methods - holograms, certificates, serial numbers - are easily replicated or forged. Consumers lack reliable tools to verify authenticity, and brands struggle to protect their heritage.

### Regulatory Pressure

The European Union's **ESPR (Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation)** mandates Digital Product Passports (DPPs) for regulated goods by 2027. Brands face a choice: build proprietary solutions that create data silos, or adopt open standards that enable interoperability.

### Data Fragmentation

Each brand's authentication system is an island. Resale platforms cannot verify items. Customs agencies lack standardized verification protocols. Consumers accumulate incompatible certificates that become worthless the moment they leave the original ecosystem.

**Galileo Protocol solves all three problems with one unified standard.**

---

## What's Included in v1.0.0

Version 1.0.0 delivers **46 specifications** (24 markdown documents + 22 JSON/JSON-LD schemas) across 8 technical domains, providing complete coverage for luxury goods authentication.

### Architecture

The foundational [hybrid on/off-chain architecture](/docs/architecture) balances transparency with privacy. On-chain components provide immutable authenticity records, while off-chain storage handles sensitive data with GDPR-compliant access controls.

- **CRAB Model**: Create, Read, Archive, Burn operations for complete lifecycle management
- **ML-DSA-65/87**: Post-quantum cryptographic signatures protecting against future threats

### Identity Framework

Our [identity system](/specifications/identity) implements the ERC-3643 v4.1.3 standard with 12 claim topics covering:

- Brand identity verification
- Artisan and craftsperson credentials
- Manufacturing facility certification
- Supply chain participant validation
- Consumer privacy-preserving authentication

### Token Standard

The [ownership transfer specification](/specifications/token/ownership-transfer) enforces a strict 1:1 relationship between physical items and digital certificates:

- 5 compliance modules for regulatory requirements
- 8-step validation pipeline ensuring data integrity
- Burn-on-transfer support for ownership transitions

### Resolver System

The [GS1 Digital Link 1.6.0 resolver](/specifications/resolver/digital-link-uri) enables universal lookups:

- 14-digit GTIN compatibility
- 4 stakeholder role types with granular permissions
- QR code and NFC integration patterns

### Data Schemas

[EPCIS 2.0-aligned schemas](/specifications/schemas/alignment/cbv-mapping) for:

- Digital Product Passport (DPP) records
- Provenance events with 5 quality grades
- Material composition and sustainability metrics

### Compliance

Built-in support for [regulatory frameworks](/docs/compliance):

- **GDPR**: Full compliance via CRAB access model
- **MiCA**: Crypto-asset regulatory readiness (July 2026)
- **ESPR**: Digital Product Passport requirements (2027)

### Infrastructure

Enterprise-grade [operational specifications](/specifications/infrastructure):

- 5 RBAC roles for access control
- 7-year audit trail retention
- Multi-region deployment patterns

### Cryptography

[Post-quantum security](/specifications/crypto/CRYPTO-AGILITY) future-proofing:

- ML-DSA-65 for standard operations
- ML-DSA-87 for high-security contexts
- Hybrid classical/PQC transition paths

## Use Cases

### For Luxury Brands

Deploy Galileo Protocol to issue verifiable digital certificates for every product. Track items through the supply chain, enable authorized resale verification, and provide customers with irrefutable proof of authenticity.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://galileo.example/v1",
  "@type": "LuxuryItem",
  "gtin": "01234567890123",
  "brand": "Maison Example",
  "category": "Haute Horlogerie",
  "authenticity": {

    "verifier": "did:galileo:brand:maison-example",
    "timestamp": "2026-02-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### For Resale Platforms

Integrate the resolver API to verify items listed on your marketplace. Provide buyers with confidence and reduce fraud-related chargebacks. Support the circular economy with trusted provenance data.

### For Regulators

Access standardized Digital Product Passport data through documented APIs. Verify compliance with ESPR requirements without requiring proprietary integrations with each brand.

### For Consumers

Scan any Galileo-enabled product to view its complete history: where it was made, who made it, every ownership transfer. Take control of your luxury investments with portable, verifiable certificates.

## What's NOT in v1.0.0

Transparency about scope is as important as feature announcements. Version 1.0.0 does **not** include:

- **Mobile SDKs**: Native iOS/Android libraries are planned for v1.1
- **Reference UI Components**: React/Vue component libraries coming in v1.2
- **Multi-chain Deployments**: v1.0.0 targets EVM-compatible chains; cross-chain bridges planned for v1.3
- **AI-powered Verification**: Computer vision authenticity checking is in research phase
- **Marketplace Integration Templates**: Shopify/WooCommerce plugins planned for future releases

These features are on our roadmap and will be delivered in subsequent minor versions.

## Governance

Galileo Protocol is developed under transparent, community-driven governance:

- **License**: Apache 2.0
- **Contributor Agreement**: DCO 1.1 (Developer Certificate of Origin)
- **Technical Steering Committee**: 11 members with anti-dominance provisions (max 2 seats per organization)
- **Decision Process**: Proposal-based with community review periods

We believe open standards are only valuable if they remain truly open.

---

## Thank You

This release would not be possible without the contributions of many individuals and organizations:

- The cryptography researchers who reviewed our post-quantum implementations
- The luxury brands who provided real-world requirements and pilot feedback
- The regulatory experts who ensured compliance framework accuracy
- The open-source community who reviewed specifications and submitted improvements

Galileo Protocol is built by the community, for the community.

**The future of luxury authenticity is open. It starts today.**
